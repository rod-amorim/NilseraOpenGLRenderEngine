 A game engine made using OpenGl, this was made with the porpouse of learning how a game engine is done in a low level

This is a game engine with a component-based architecture, where you can create components and attach them to game objects. Everything is done through code there is no editor.

The engine also includes a basic hierarchy system, allowing objects to be parented to others. The position and rotation of child objects are always relative to their parent.

I developed this project in about three weeks while reading the book Learn OpenGL. It is still unfinished, but I have implemented basic shading and three types of lights: directional, spot, and point.

It is possible to load 3D models using Assimp.

This project is far from complete, and I don't think it should be used seriously. However, I'm uploading it here in case I ever decide to revisit it or start another engine from scratch. Overall, the amount I’ve learned from this project is immeasurable I now feel much more comfortable with C++, shaders, and how they work.
